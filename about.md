## Notes on nim as a first language  

I'm learning nim as a first language. I don't *really* know how to code but I'm not completely illiterate either. By that, I mean, I can setup a static site using flask and throw it up on heroku for a resume but I definitely can't code myself out of a paperbag (I didn't know modulus existed up until I looked up certain solutions for leetcode ~~bdsm~~ *"easy"* problems.)

### *Yes, I know this is not going to help me find a programming job but at least it's fun (ty javascript /s)*
